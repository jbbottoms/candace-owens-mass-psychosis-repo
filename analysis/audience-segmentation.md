# Audience Enumeration Model

She's not building an audience. She's building a segmented database.

## The Real Product

She's not selling mugs. She's building an org chart.

**Tier 1-3:** Revenue (views, ads, merch)  
**Tier 4:** Committed base (subscriptions, consistent purchases)  
**Tier 5:** Operatives (free research, defense, recruitment)

The conspiracy content is the **recruiting pipeline**. Each escalation filters for deeper commitment. By the time you accept time-traveling Sumerians, you're not just a viewer - you're part of the operation.

## Comparison: Cults vs Content Creators

| Traditional Cult | Candace's Model |
|------------------|------------------|
| Isolation from family | Isolation from "mainstream narrative" |
| Special knowledge | "Truth they won't tell you" |
| Leader has unique access | "Sources close to the situation" |
| Outsiders are threat | Critics are "feds" |
| Contradictions = test of faith | Timezone errors = attacks on details |
| Members recruit | Tier 5 recruits |
| Donations required | Mug purchases |
| Can't question leader | Questioning = fed behavior |

Same mechanics. Different platform.
