## Key Commits Analysis

**The `hotfix: timezone error UTC vs utah (kept claim anyway)` commit (8e1f6b3)**

This is the entire methodology:
1. Ship broken code
2. Get called out
3. Patch the docs but not the logic
4. Keep the conclusion

In any real repo that's a revert. In her architecture it's a feature.

**The `IGNORED: erika asks candace to stop` commit (1e6b9f7)**

Primary source (the widow) rejected. Crowdsourced "pregnant mommy sleuth" (anonymous) accepted. This is the validation function in action.
