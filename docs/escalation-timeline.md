# Escalation Timeline

## Phase 1: Questioning the Official Narrative (September-October 2025)
- Kirk assassinated Sept 10, 2025 by Tyler Robinson
- Owens starts questioning whether Robinson acted alone

## Phase 2: Egyptian Planes (November 2025)
- Claims two Egyptian Air Force planes tracked Erika Kirk "73 times"
- Made timezone errors, corrected but continued anyway
- "Pregnant mommy sleuth" discovers flight data

## Phase 3: French Foreign Legion (November-December 2025)
- Claims Legionnaires were at UVU on September 10
- Demands FBI confirm or deny
- References training exercises weeks prior

## Phase 4: Assassination Plot Against Her (November 2025)
- Claims Macron ordered her assassination
- Names specific hit squad composition (GIGN + 1 Israeli + French-Canadian woman)

- X-Men school, childhood surveillance
- Sumerian technology
- Cousin's "frequency tests find gifted children" → "instantly believed"

## The Pattern

Each layer insulates the previous. When one claim gets debunked, pivot to something unfalsifiable. When geopolitics runs out, pivot to metaphysics.

**Escalation Strategy:**
1. Start with verifiable claims (flight data)
2. Add timezone errors but keep conclusion
3. Merge contradictions upward ("they're all connected")
4. When falsifiable claims fail, pivot to unfalsifiable (dreams, time travel)
5. Build audience commitment at each tier

**Why It Works:**

By the time you reach Phase 6, you've already accepted:
- The official narrative is false
- Multiple governments are coordinating
- Evidence from anonymous sources > primary sources
- Timeline errors don't invalidate conclusions

Once those are accepted, time travel is just "one more thing."
